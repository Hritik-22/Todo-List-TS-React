# React TypeScript To-Do Project

### Author
Hello! I'm **Ritik Dubey**, and this is my first project built using TypeScript with React.

## Project Overview

This is a simple yet functional To-Do application developed using **React** and **TypeScript**. The app allows users to create, read, and manage a list of tasks, and it stores task data locally using the browser's local storage.

### Key Features
- **Add and Manage Tasks**: Easily add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved in local storage, so they persist even when the browser is refreshed.
- **Data Context**: Data is passed efficiently using React's Context API.
- **TypeScript Integration**: This project leverages TypeScript for type safety, making it more robust and scalable.

## Tech Stack
- **React** (v18+)
- **TypeScript**
- **Context API** (for state management)
- **Local Storage** (for saving tasks)

## Project Setup
